1. Study on rendering techniques, like SSAO, HDR, deferred light(point, spot).
2. For some added graphic effect, I must provide convienient parameters tune support in SceneEdit, like PSSM, SSAO.
3. Simple Material parameter editor in which can set differcent material's specular intensity, specular multiplier, emissive multiplier, blend type and so on.
