2. For some added graphic effect, I must provide convienient parameters tuning support in SceneEdit, like PSSM, SSAO.		

Done.

3. Simple Material parameter editor in which can set differcent material's specular intensity, specular multiplier, 
emissive multiplier, blend type and so on. This also means deferred shading pipeline must update to deferred lighting.
