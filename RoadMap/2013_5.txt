1. Game start menu and loading screen.

Successfully steal the start menu from GameMenu demo of CEGUI, haha.

2. Study and implement steering behaviors with Recast and Detour libraries (May be it doesn't support 
all of them, then I am on my own.. Anyway, We need flocking, aggregating and so on, to make units behavior
more reliable).Search "steering behaviors" on youtube to see more interesting videos.

3. Continue to write units battling logic. If goes all right, introducing more kinds of unit.

4.Fog of War!
