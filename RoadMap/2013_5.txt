1. Game start menu and loading screen.

[100%]	Successfully steal the start menu from GameMenu demo of CEGUI, haha.

2. Study and implement steering behaviors with Recast and Detour libraries (May be it doesn't support 
all of them, then I am on my own.. Anyway, We need flocking, aggregating and so on, to make units behavior
more reliable).Search "steering behaviors" on youtube to see more interesting videos.

3. Continue to write units battling logic. If goes alright, introducing more kinds of unit.

Summarise: I left my current job this month and were looking for new job. Really little work done for this month. Anyway, I want to join next suitable company as soon as possible :D

BTW: I think I should be focus on one area and keep research it, namely graphical rendering. Intelligent decision, right? :P
